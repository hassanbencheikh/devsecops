# DevSecOps Lab - Automated Python API Deployment with Docker and Git

## Overview

This lab demonstrates a complete CI/CD pipeline for a Python Flask API that performs basic arithmetic operations. The project includes automated monitoring, Docker containerization, Git version control, and Docker Hub integration.

## Features

- **Python Flask API** with four arithmetic endpoints (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide)
- **Docker containerization** for consistent deployment
- **Automated monitoring** that detects code changes and rebuilds containers
- **Git integration** for version control and remote monitoring
- **Docker Hub integration** for image repository management

- Kali Linux (or any Linux distribution)
- Docker installed and running
- Git installed and configured
- Docker Hub account
- `inotify-tools` installed for file monitoring
- Python 3.9+ (included in Docker image)
